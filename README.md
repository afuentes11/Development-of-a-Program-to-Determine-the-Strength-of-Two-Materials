# Development-of-a-Program-to-Determine-the-Strength-of-Two-Materials
## Description
Program to determine the maximum load, the maximum normal stress, the permanent deformation and the residual stress of a part made of two different materials subjected to an axial load

## Instructions
#### Windows
```vbnet
REM Clone the repository on your computer
git clone https://github.com/afuentes11/Development-of-a-Program-to-Determine-the-Strength-of-Two-Materials.git

REM Enter the folder
cd Development-of-a-Program-to-Determine-the-Strength-of-Two-Materials

REM Create a virtual environment with python
py -m venv venv

REM Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

REM Install the libraries from the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

REM Finished 
```

Following this configuration you will be able to run the main.py file without any problem.

 - The following command is used to deactivate the virtual environment
```vbnet

.\venv\Scripts\deactivate

```

#### Linux

git clone https://github.com/afuentes11/Development-of-a-Program-to-Determine-the-Strength-of-Two-Materials.git

# Enter the folder
cd Development-of-a-Program-to-Determine-the-Strength-of-Two-Materials

# Create a virtual environment with python
py -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the libraries from the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Finished 
```

Following this configuration you will be able to run the main.py file without any problem.

 - The following command is used to deactivate the virtual environment
